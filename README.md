# Structured AI Workflow for Consistent Content Creation

This project demonstrates a code-driven AI workflow designed to generate structured, reproducible prompts for AI-generated content, including images, video, audio, and AI-driven influencers.

## Overview
Instead of relying on manual prompting, this system programmatically builds prompts using structured inputs (JSON) to ensure consistency, scalability, and character continuity across AI outputs.

## Features
- Code-based prompt generation using Python
- Structured input schemas for characters, style, and constraints
- Designed for integration with ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion
- Supports consistent AI influencer and visual identity generation
- Modular and extensible workflow architecture

## Example Use Case
- Generate consistent AI influencer images
- Feed structured prompts into ComfyUI workflows
- Scale content creation without prompt drift

## Tech Stack
- Python
- JSON
- Generative AI
- ComfyUI (integration-ready)

## How It Works
1. Define character and style in structured JSON
2. Python pipeline builds positive and negative prompts
3. Prompts are fed into ComfyUI for image generation

## Status
Proof of concept / system design demo
